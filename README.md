"eBooks" is not a valid Dart package name.

The name should be all lowercase, with underscores to separate words, "just_like_this".Use only basic Latin letters and Arabic digits: [a-z0-9_].Also, make sure the name is a valid Dart identifier—that it doesn't start with digits and isn't a reserved word.

Note: meta is pinned to version 1.15.0 by flutter_test from the flutter SDK.
See https://dart.dev/go/sdk-version-pinning for details.
Because every version of flutter_test from sdk depends on meta any which doesn't exist (authorization failed), flutter_test from sdk is forbidden.
So, because lithabit depends on flutter_test from sdk, version solving failed.
