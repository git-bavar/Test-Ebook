"eBooks" is not a valid Dart package name.

The name should be all lowercase, with underscores to separate words, "just_like_this".Use only basic Latin letters and Arabic digits: [a-z0-9_].Also, make sure the name is a valid Dart identifier—that it doesn't start with digits and isn't a reserved word.
See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#name for more information.
Try "ebooks" instead.
